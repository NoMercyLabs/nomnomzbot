# Design-system component catalogue (authoritative manifest)

The **closed, authoritative list** of shadcn components ported to Compose, referenced by
`frontend-design-system.md` §4. This file is the **linter's input**: a component may exist in
`core/designsystem/component/` only if it has a complete row here, and every row must be fully filled
(no blank variant/size/state/base cell) before the component is built. The §4 table in the design-
system spec is a readable summary; **this file is the source of truth**.

**Conventions (per `frontend-design-system.md`):** one component = one file, named exactly as shadcn;
variants/sizes are shadcn's exact published set (new-york, version-pinned); the **base** is the
most-correct primitive (DS7); every component is a pure, token-driven, stateless composable whose style
comes from a `resolve(variant, size, state, tokens)` lookup. `InteractionState` is the closed flag set
in §4.2. Foundation = `androidx.compose.foundation`; M3 = a themed `androidx.compose.material3` wrapper;
`Popup`/`Dialog` = Compose's overlay primitives.

## Adding a component (the closed-growth rule)

A new component is added when a screen needs it (Rule of Three over speculative ports), by appending a
**fully-filled row** here and creating `core/designsystem/component/<Name>.kt` with its variant/size
enums + `resolve()`. The `nomnomz-component` scaffold (`frontend-structure.md` §6) drops both, with the
row pre-stubbed; the linter fails the build on a row with any empty cell or a component file with no
matching row.
