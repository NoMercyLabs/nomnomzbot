## Open

### 2026-07-17 — Discord: the guild-notification backend is COMPLETE — the page just doesn't surface it
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** the owner's "no way of adding it properly to a guild's channel" is a UI gap — the full
  flow exists under `channels/{channelId}/discord/...`: (1) install the bot via
  `GET .../integrations/discord/callback/start` (OAuth, consent auto-approved on install);
  (2) toggle `PUT connections/{id}/streamer-enabled` — **nothing fires until this is on**, surface it
  prominently; (3) pick a channel from the LIVE directory `GET connections/{id}/guild/channels`
  (+ `/guild/roles` for the ping role); (4) create a `go_live` rule via `POST connections/{id}/configs`
  (targetChannelId, pingRoleId?, messageTemplate, embed) — the bot then announces on stream.online
  with dedupe; `GET connections/{id}/dispatch-log` shows every send. Notify roles + the self-assign
  button: `POST connections/{id}/roles` then `POST roles/{id}/button` posts a click-to-opt-in button
  into a chosen channel. Build the Discord page as: connect → enable → "Add announcement" wizard
  (channel picker + role picker + template) → rules list with dispatch log.
  **Personal live DMs (new):** notify roles now carry `dmEnabled` (in `DiscordNotificationRoleDto`,
  create + update requests). When ON, every opted-in member of that role also gets the go-live
  notification as a Discord DM (best-effort — members with closed DMs are skipped, visible as
  `failed` rows in the dispatch log with dedupe keys ending `:dm:{memberId}`). UI: a "Also DM
  members" switch on the notify-role card (create + edit), with a hint that members opt in via the
  button and can block DMs server-side. Kotlin mirrors to sync: `DiscordNotificationRole`,
  `CreateDiscordRoleBody`, `UpdateDiscordRoleBody` in `core/network/DiscordApi.kt` — add
  `dmEnabled: Boolean = false` to each; refresh from `server/openapi/v1.json`.
- **Why:** owner item — "the discord section is not useful at all, there is no way of adding it
  properly to a guild's channel, and there is no option for a user to get personal live
  notification dm's" — both halves are now backend-complete.
- **Where:** `feature/integrations` Discord screen; all routes already in `server/openapi/v1.json`.
- **Done when:** installing to a test guild, enabling, picking a channel, and going live posts the
  announcement — configured entirely from the dashboard on dev.

### 2026-07-17 — Moderation: bot-side standing tiers (mute / shadowban / blacklist)
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** the per-user mod panel gains graduated BOT-SIDE tiers, distinct from Twitch ban/timeout:
  `POST channels/{channelId}/moderation/users/{userId}/standing` (body: `provider`, `standing`
  = `muted` | `shadowbanned` | `blacklisted`, `reason?`) and `DELETE .../standing?provider=` to
  restore normal. `GET users/{userId}/context` now carries `standings` (one per platform identity).
  Semantics to surface in the UI: **muted** — chat still shows, the bot ignores them (no commands/
  triggers/votes/giveaways/earning); **shadowbanned** — muted + hidden from overlays; **blacklisted**
  — the bot drops their chat entirely (not persisted, not displayed). Per-platform (a Twitch mute
  doesn't mute their Kick identity); the broadcaster can't be assigned one (409); every change
  auto-writes a system note (visible in the notes list). UI: a standing selector on the user panel
  beside warn/suspicious, with tier explanations and the current standing badge.
- **Why:** owner item — "moderation needs to be more robust ... muted ... shadow banned ...
  blacklisted". Spec: moderation.md §9 decision 3 (J.12).
- **Where:** `feature/moderation` user panel; contract refreshed in `server/openapi/v1.json`.
- **Done when:** muting a test user from the panel stops their commands within seconds while their
  chat stays visible, and blacklisting makes their lines vanish from the dashboard feed — on dev.

### 2026-07-17 — Music: shareable song-request link + the player controls that already exist
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** (1) NEW shareable SR link: `GET/POST /api/v1/public/sr/by-channel/{channelName}` mirror
  the token routes (`@` prefix and case both tolerated), resolving only channels that have engaged
  their SR page — so the public page can live at `/sr/@channelname` and streamers can just say the
  URL on stream. Add a "Copy share link" button on the music page emitting that pretty URL (keep the
  token URL working). (2) The player-control gaps the owner listed are BACKEND-COMPLETE already —
  `POST music/skip|pause|resume|seek`, `PATCH music/shuffle`, `PATCH music/repeat`, and
  `GET music/now-playing` (which carries progress): wire the dashboard player to them — skip/shuffle/
  repeat buttons and a progress bar that polls now-playing (or ticks locally between polls) WHILE
  playing, not only on pause.
- **Why:** owner item — "the music page is a disorganized mess ... progress bar ... skip ... shuffle
  ... repeat ... no way of sharing the public version of that page because that page link is just a
  token." The page reorganization itself is design/frontend work.
- **Where:** `feature/music` + the public SR page widget routing (`/sr/@name` → by-channel API);
  contract refreshed in `server/openapi/v1.json`.
- **Done when:** the share link opens the SR page by channel name on dev, and the dashboard player
  skips/shuffles/repeats with a live-updating progress bar.

### 2026-07-17 — Chat polls: bot-run polls with chat-number voting (every platform)
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** new surface under `channels/{channelId}/chat-polls` (`ChatPollDto`): `POST` opens a poll
  (question + 2–10 options, optional `durationSeconds` auto-close, `announce` posts it in chat),
  viewers vote by typing the option number in chat on ANY platform (last vote wins, one per viewer),
  `GET` lists (open poll first with LIVE per-option tallies + `totalVotes`, then history),
  `GET {pollId}` one poll, `POST {pollId}/close` closes now (winner announced in chat). One open poll
  per channel (409 otherwise). Distinct from the Twitch-native live-ops polls (affiliate-gated,
  channel-point voting) — keep both on the polls page, labeled "Chat poll" vs "Twitch poll". UI:
  open-poll card with live bars (poll the GET every few seconds), close button, history list.
- **Why:** owner item — "custom polls and surveys ... view results in real-time"; works for
  non-affiliates and across YouTube/Kick simulcasts.
- **Where:** `feature/community` or the live-ops page; contract refreshed in `server/openapi/v1.json`
  (3 new paths).
- **Done when:** opening a poll from the dashboard announces it in chat, typed numbers move the bars,
  and closing announces the winner — verified on dev.

### 2026-07-16 — Chat triggers: keyword auto-replies ("someone says X → the bot reacts")
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** new CRUD under `channels/{channelId}/chat-triggers` (`ChatTriggerDto`): pattern +
  matchType (`contains` | `exact` | `starts_with` | `regex`), caseSensitive, isEnabled, response
  (template, same `{user}`/`{args}` variables as commands) OR pipelineId (chained reactions),
  cooldownSeconds (spam guard, default 30), minPermissionLevel (0 = everyone). POST/PATCH validate
  server-side (a regex must compile; a trigger needs a response or a pipeline) — surface those 400s
  inline. Changes are live instantly (the bot's cache refreshes on every write). Build a "Chat
  triggers" page (fits beside Commands): list + create/edit dialog with a match-type picker and a
  response-vs-pipeline toggle.
- **Why:** owner item — "Allow users to set up automated responses for specific chat messages or
  commands" (the commands half already exists; this is the chat-message half).
- **Where:** `feature/commands` (or a sibling); contract refreshed in `server/openapi/v1.json`
  (2 new paths; note the snapshot reordered paths — structural diff only).
- **Done when:** creating a "contains: good bot" trigger from the dashboard makes the bot reply in
  live chat within seconds, edits apply without restart, verified on dev.

### 2026-07-16 — Rewards: countdown timers for time-limited redemptions
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** a reward can now carry `timerDurationSeconds` (set via the reward create/update DTOs; 0
  clears, capped 24h). Redeeming such a reward auto-starts a countdown. New endpoints under
  `channels/{channelId}/rewards`: `GET redemption-timers` (active first, then recent history —
  `RedemptionTimerDto`: id, redemptionId, rewardId, rewardTitle, redeemedBy, durationSeconds,
  remainingSeconds (LIVE clock-derived at response time), status running|paused|completed|canceled,
  startedAt) and `POST redemption-timers/{timerId}/pause|resume|complete|cancel`. Complete (manual or
  automatic at expiry) fulfills the redemption on Twitch; cancel just stops counting (refund stays the
  existing refund endpoint). UI: a timer field on the reward editor + a live countdown card/list on
  the rewards (or live-ops) page with pause/resume/complete/cancel — poll the list or re-fetch on
  action; remainingSeconds is exact at fetch time so client-side ticking from it is safe.
- **Why:** owner item — "start, stop and pause a timer for certain reward redemptions that are time
  limited... the timer stops and the reward is marked as completed."
- **Where:** `feature/rewards`; contract refreshed in `server/openapi/v1.json`.
- **Done when:** setting a duration on a reward, redeeming it, watching the countdown live, pausing/
  resuming, and seeing the redemption fulfilled at zero — all verified on the dev web build.

### 2026-07-16 — Event responses ARE the reaction chains: merge alerts/events into one page
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** the full "welcome them in" chain (sound → overlay → chat, any order, with waits) already
  works backend-side: every event type on `GET .../event-responses` can bind `responseType:
  "pipeline"` to a pipeline that chains `play_sound`, `widget_event` (overlay push), `play_tts`,
  `send_message`, `wait`, and every other palette action. NEW trigger:
  `engagement.session_first_message` fires the first time a user speaks during THIS stream
  (session-scoped, cleared on stream start — distinct from `engagement.first_time_chatter` which is
  first-EVER). Its preset is in the catalog endpoint. Also: the seeding now TOPS UP — revisiting the
  page adds rows for newly shipped trigger types. UI work: (1) present Alerts / Events / Event
  Responses as ONE surface (they are one backend concept now); (2) make "bind a pipeline" a
  first-class flow from the event row (create-and-bind, not paste-an-id); (3) show the new trigger.
- **Why:** owner items — reaction chains on any event, "alerts and events need to be merged with
  event responses and triggers". Note: a "user joins/leaves the channel" trigger is NOT offered —
  Twitch's supported API (EventSub) has no viewer presence events (IRC JOIN/PART is retired); the
  session-first-message trigger is the honest equivalent.
- **Where:** `feature/eventresponses` (+ wherever Alerts currently lives); contract in
  `server/openapi/v1.json`.
- **Done when:** one page lists every trigger incl. session-first-message, an operator can chain
  sound+overlay+chat on it without leaving the page, and the chain fires live on dev.

### 2026-07-16 — Analytics: per-stream views ("stream by stream, not all-time")
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** two new management-plane reads under
  `GET /api/v1/channels/{channelId}/analytics/streams` (paginated stream history, newest first —
  `StreamListItemDto`: streamId, title, gameName, startedAt, endedAt, durationSeconds (null while
  live), peakViewers) and `.../analytics/streams/{streamId}` (`StreamAnalyticsDto`: the list fields
  plus totalMessages, uniqueChatters, newFollowers, newSubscribers, cheersCount, commandsRun,
  redemptionsCount — window-folded between the stream's start and end, or "now" while live). Build
  the analytics page a stream picker/list on top of these so every stat can be read per stream; the
  stream's startedAt/endedAt window is also what to use for scoping the chat/history views per
  stream.
- **Why:** owner item — "analytics, chat and everything stream related needs to be shown stream by
  stream and not all-time."
- **Where:** `feature/analytics`; contract refreshed in `server/openapi/v1.json`.
- **Done when:** the analytics page can switch between all-time and a specific stream, showing that
  stream's own numbers, verified on the dev web build.

### 2026-07-16 — Pre-fill every template input from the new preset catalog
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** `GET /api/v1/channels/{channelId}/event-responses/catalog` returns one preset per
  configurable event type: `eventType`, `defaultTemplate` (a ready-to-send line using `{placeholder}`
  syntax), and `variables` (the EXACT placeholders that event seeds — safe to offer as insert chips).
  Pre-fill the event-response message input with `defaultTemplate` whenever the stored message is
  empty, and surface `variables` next to the field. For the custom-command and timer template inputs
  (no per-type presets needed): pre-fill commands with a default like `Hello {user}!` — commands seed
  `{user}`, `{user.name}`, `{target}`, `{args}`, `{args.count}`, `{args.N}` — and timers with a plain
  text default (timers have no per-event variables).
- **Why:** owner item — "i am missing the pre-filled templates in all the template input fields."
- **Where:** `feature/eventresponses` dialog + command/timer create dialogs; new endpoint in
  `server/openapi/v1.json` (`EventResponsePresetDto`).
- **Done when:** opening any template input on a fresh channel shows a sensible pre-filled template
  instead of an empty field, verified on the dev web build.

### 2026-07-16 — Auth round-trips: send `return_to` so the user lands back on the page they left
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** the browser OAuth flows now carry an optional `return_to` query param (a same-origin
  RELATIVE path like `/commands` or `/settings?tab=identity` — anything else is dropped server-side):
  `GET /api/v1/auth/twitch?client=web&return_to=...`, `GET /api/v1/auth/{provider}/authorize?...`,
  and `POST /api/v1/auth/identities/{provider}/link?...`. On success the callback 302s to
  `{origin}{return_to}#access_token=...` (login) or `{origin}{return_to}#linked=...` (link) instead
  of always the home page. Frontend work: (1) pass the CURRENT route as `return_to` when starting
  any web OAuth hop; (2) parse the `#access_token`/`#linked`/`#link_error` fragment on EVERY route,
  not just the root, then strip it and stay on that route.
- **Why:** owner item — "after redirecting from auth providers, the user is not redirected back to
  the page they were on before the redirect". Backend leg shipped; the visible fix needs the app to
  send the param and restore the route.
- **Where:** login/link flow starters in `core/network` + the fragment handling in the app bootstrap;
  contract refreshed in `server/openapi/v1.json` (3 new query params).
- **Done when:** starting a re-auth or identity link from any dashboard page returns to that page
  with the session/link applied, verified on the dev web build.

### 2026-07-16 — Home screen: render the new real stats (subs, chatters, donations)
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** `GET /api/v1/dashboard/{channelId}/stats` (`DashboardStatsDto`) now carries six new
  fields — `subscriberCount` (real Helix total), `chattersToday` (distinct hashed chatters, UTC day),
  `supporterEventsToday`, `supporterAmountMinorToday` + `supporterCurrency` (minor units; the amount
  pair is NULL on a mixed-currency or amount-less day — show the event count alone then, never a
  fabricated 0.00), and `platformsLive` (string array, alphabetical — the platforms the owner is live
  on right now: `"twitch"` / `"youtube"` / `"kick"`, as tracked by the bot; render as platform badges,
  empty array = fully offline). Add them to the Kotlin `DashboardStats` DTO (additive,
  drift-guard-safe) and render them on the home screen next to viewers/followers. Divide the amount
  by 100 for display.
- **Why:** the owner's home-screen ask — "current viewers, chatters, followers, subscribers,
  donations, platforms streaming to". The backend now serves all of these truthfully (the old
  followerCount was already real; its doc comment lied).
- **Where:** `core/network` DashboardStats DTO + `feature/home/ui/HomeScreen.kt`; contract refreshed
  in `server/openapi/v1.json`.
- **Done when:** the home screen shows subs/chatters/donations/platforms-live from a live backend,
  with the mixed-currency day rendering as a count without an amount.

### 2026-07-16 — Supporters page: one-step webhook connect (secret in the upsert, ingest URL on the DTO)
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** the Supporters page can now connect a webhook provider (kofi / fourthwall / shopify /
  patreon / buymeacoffee) in ONE step. Update the connect flow to: (1) send the provider's
  verification secret as `authSecret` in the `PUT /api/v1/supporters/connections` upsert — the old
  "backend rejects a webhook authSecret" behavior is GONE (update the stale comment in
  `SupportersApi.kt`); (2) render the new `SupporterConnection.endpointUrl` field (add it to the
  Kotlin DTO — additive, drift-guard-safe) with a copy button: it is the ingest URL the streamer
  pastes into the provider's webhook settings. Re-sending a secret rotates the endpoint in place;
  deleting the connection retires the endpoint.
- **Why:** connecting Ko-fi previously took two pages (create the endpoint on Webhooks, then enable
  the connection on Supporters). The backend now auto-provisions the inbound endpoint from the
  connection upsert and returns the URL.
- **Where:** `core/network/SupportersApi.kt` (DTO + doc comments), `feature/supporters` connect UI;
  backend contract in `server/openapi/v1.json` (refreshed, `SupporterConnectionDto.endpointUrl`).
- **Done when:** connecting Ko-fi from the Supporters page with its verification token shows the
  ingest URL to copy, without visiting the Webhooks page; disconnect removes it.

### 2026-07-16 — Desktop scope re-grant: route through the device flow (redirect can't widen there)
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** in `IntegrationsController.regrantScopes()`, make the **desktop** target always use
  `regrantScopesViaDevice` (the `POST /twitch/diagnostics/regrant` device flow) instead of the
  redirect, even when a client secret is configured. Web can keep the redirect.
- **Why:** the "permissions needed" banner never cleared because the redirect re-grant requested only
  the static base scope set — a runtime-detected gap (e.g. `moderator:manage:announcements`) or an
  extra held scope (`user:bot`) never rode along. The backend now widens the redirect's scope set to
  `base ∪ granted ∪ recorded-missing` by peeking the web session cookie — but a **desktop** re-grant
  opens the system browser, which carries no dashboard cookie, so only the device path (whose scope
  set the backend computes server-side) is fully additive there.
- **Where:** `feature/integrations/state/IntegrationsController.kt` (`regrantScopes`); no API
  contract change (the device re-grant endpoint already exists and is what the secret-less path uses).
- **Done when:** on desktop, pressing "Grant" on the missing-permissions card opens the device-code
  panel (user code + twitch.tv/activate), and after approval the card clears — including for a
  runtime-detected scope outside the base set.

### 2026-07-14 — Widget code editor: full Vue SFC + TypeScript IntelliSense (owner requirement)
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** the owner wants the in-dashboard widget code editor (the "VSCode-style" editor) to give
  **full Vue SFC autocomplete + full TypeScript IntelliSense** when editing `.vue` widgets authored with
  `<script setup lang="ts">` — Vue template autocomplete (component props, directives, bindings),
  `<script setup>` type-checking, and TS completions/hover/diagnostics, all in-browser (the Wasm dashboard
  has no server language backend). This is the editing DX for the first-party + custom Vue widgets.
- **Recommended approach:** the **Vue language service (Volar)** in a Web Worker, wired to the editor over
  LSP. Standard browser stack: **Monaco + `@volar/monaco` + `@vue/language-service`** (+ the TS worker for
  `lang="ts"`); CodeMirror can host an LSP client too, but Monaco has first-class Volar integration. The
  dashboard is Compose/Wasm (canvas-rendered), so the editor is a DOM-interop surface — architect the
  Monaco/Volar embed within that interop (however the current CodeMirror editor is embedded is the
  reference). Widgets have no `node_modules`, so the Vue + TS type environment (vue types, `lib.d.ts`) must
  be supplied to the language service in-worker.
- **Why:** the widget framework is moving to **Vue SFC** (`framework: "vue"`); the owner explicitly requires
  parity with a real Vue editor. Frontend-only — it does NOT touch the backend compile path (the bot compiles
  the SFC on save via `POST .../compile`, unchanged).
- **Where:** `core/editor` (the existing CodeMirror editor) + `feature/widgets` editor screen. No backend
  contract change. The server-side Vue SFC **compiler** engine is a separate backend decision in progress
  (Jint vs ClearScript/V8) and does not affect this editor work.
- **Done when:** editing a `.vue` widget with `<script setup lang="ts">` gives working Vue template + TS
  autocomplete, hover types, and inline diagnostics in the dashboard editor (desktop + web).

### 2026-07-14 — Widgets/Overlays editor: rewire to compile-on-save (BREAKING contract change)
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** the widget subsystem was rebuilt to the `widgets-overlays.md` spec. The old
  "PUT `customCode`" save path is **gone** — the editor now creates a widget, then **compiles**
  authored source into an append-only version that the overlay serves + hot-reloads. Rewire the
  "Overlays" page + code editor to this flow:
  1. **Create** → `POST /channels/{id}/widgets` with `{ name, framework }` where `framework` ∈
     `vanilla|react|vue|svelte` (**renamed from `type`**; only `vanilla` + `react` compile today).
     Offer a template picker from **`GET /channels/{id}/widgets/templates`** →
     `WidgetTemplate{ key, name, description, framework, source }` (3 starter vanilla widgets; seed
     the editor with `source`).
  2. **Load source to edit** → `GET /channels/{id}/widgets/{widgetId}/versions/{versionId}` →
     `WidgetVersionDetail.sourceCode` (use the widget's `activeVersionId`, or the newest from
     `GET .../versions`). `WidgetDetail` **no longer has `customCode`**.
  3. **Save = compile** → `POST /channels/{id}/widgets/{widgetId}/compile` with `{ sourceCode }` →
     `WidgetVersionDetail{ buildStatus: pending|success|error, buildError?, buildLog?, contentHash }`.
     Always 200; if `buildStatus == "error"`, show `buildError` in the editor (the overlay keeps the
     last good version). On success the overlay hot-reloads itself.
  4. **Version history / rollback** → `GET .../versions` (newest first) + `POST .../rollback/{versionId}`.
  5. **Clone** → replace the client-side "Copy of…" re-POST with **`POST /channels/{id}/widgets/clone`**
     `{ installedWidgetId }` → a new live custom widget (source copied + compiled).
- **Why:** `WidgetDetail` changed shape — now `{ id, name, description?, framework, source, isEnabled,
  overlayUrl?, activeVersionId?, galleryItemId?, settings, eventSubscriptions, lastRuntimeError?,
  lastRanAt?, createdAt, updatedAt }` (was `{ type, customCode, … }`). `CreateWidgetRequest` uses
  `framework` (not `type`) and dropped `customCode`; `UpdateWidgetRequest` dropped `customCode`
  (it now patches name/description/settings/subscriptions/enabled only). The old editor's `saveCode`
  (PUT customCode) is now a silent no-op → the editor is broken against the new backend until rewired.
- **Where:** `feature/widgets/` (WidgetsScreen/WidgetsController), `core/network/WidgetsApi.kt`
  (DTOs + calls), `core/editor` (unchanged — the CodeMirror editor is reused; just feed it the version
  source + save via /compile). The overlay runtime (host page + SDK + bundle serving) is **100% backend**
  — no frontend work: the OBS browser source is `WidgetDetail.overlayUrl`, unchanged.
- **Gate-2 keys:** `widget:read` (list/get/versions/templates), `widget:write` (create/update/delete/
  clone), `widget:compile`, `widget:version:read`, `widget:rollback` — all seeded.
- **✅ Backend refreshed `server/openapi/v1.json`** for these DTO changes (this commit). Now in the
  snapshot: `WidgetDetail`/`CreateWidgetRequest`/`UpdateWidgetRequest` (CustomCode dropped;
  framework/source/activeVersionId/eventSubscriptions/settings added), plus `CompileWidgetRequest`,
  `CloneWidgetRequest`, `WidgetVersionSummary`/`WidgetVersionDetail`, `WidgetTemplate`,
  `OverlayManifest`/`OverlayWidgetEntry`. Resync the Kotlin DTOs against it and register the new shapes in
  `ApiContractTest` (`:composeApp:jvmTest`). Backend-verified live: create→compile→overlay URL renders the
  bundle in the sandboxed iframe with the SDK bridge + saved settings.
- **Done when:** create-from-template → edit in the code editor → Save compiles + the OBS overlay URL
  renders the widget and hot-reloads on save; a build error shows in the editor; version list + rollback
  work; clone produces a live, independently-editable copy; en + nl strings.

### 2026-07-11 — Media-share page: mod queue + overlay widget (viewer clip/video queue)
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** two surfaces. (1) A **mod queue** page: list submissions (filter by status), approve/reject/
  skip/reorder pending+approved items, edit the config. (2) A **`media_share` OBS overlay widget** that
  plays the current clip and shows the upcoming queue. Endpoints (in `server/openapi/v1.json`, tag
  "Media Share", under `/media-share`): `GET queue?status=`, `GET next` (the overlay pulls this — it flips
  the item to *playing*), `POST {id}/approve|reject|skip|reorder|played`, `GET/PUT config`
  (`UpdateMediaShareConfigRequest`). Submissions come from viewers via the `!media <url>` chat command and
  a `submit_media` pipeline action (redeem-to-submit) — NOT from this page.
- **Why:** parity item 11 (StreamElements media-share). Safe-by-default: approval on, Twitch-clip +
  YouTube only, a hard duration cap. Items carry `title`, `durationSeconds`, `thumbnailUrl`, `sourceType`
  (`twitch_clip`|`youtube`), `mediaRef` (clip slug / YouTube id) — render the embed from those.
- **Where:** new `feature/mediaShare` page + the overlay widget (the overlay host already exists; drive it
  off `GET next` → play the embed → `POST {id}/played` on completion). Register the DTOs in
  `ApiContractTest`. Role gating: read + moderate the queue at Moderator (`media:read` / `media:moderate`);
  config write at Editor (`media:write`). Destructive skip/reject confirm.
- **Done when:** a submitted clip appears pending → approve → the overlay plays it → marks played →
  advances; reject/skip refund shows; the config (enable, approval, sources, cap, cost, cooldown)
  round-trips; en + nl strings.

### 2026-07-11 — Stream schedule & markers (item 17) — DONE except the .ics link
- **✅ Markers — DONE:** one-tap "Mark moment" button in the Home live-ops quick-actions (gated on
  `stats.isLive`; surfaces the Twitch error on failure). E2E-verified against dev.
- **✅ Schedule page — DONE:** a new **Schedule** page under the Stream nav group — reads the live Twitch
  schedule and manages it (add / edit / delete a segment + the vacation window). `ScheduleController` +
  `ScheduleScreen` + full nav wiring + `ScheduleControllerTest`; en + nl. Datetimes are ISO-8601 text /
  durations minutes (Compose has no native date picker yet; the backend validates). Compile + jvmTest green.
- **⏳ Remaining (small):** the **.ics subscribe link** (`GET .../live-ops/schedule/icalendar`) — deferred
  because the endpoint needs auth a calendar app can't send; pending a token-query mechanism (logged for
  backend). (The earlier dev 502 on `GET /live-ops/schedule` is **fixed** — it was the page-size default
  exceeding Twitch's schedule cap of 25; the page now renders the real schedule.)

### 2026-07-11 — Kick integration: connect tile + chat feed provider tag
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** Kick is now a full chat platform on the backend. Two frontend touches:
  1. The integrations screen: Kick now appears in `GET /channels/{id}/integrations/status` (provider
     `"kick"`) exactly like Spotify/YouTube — render its tile and wire the connect button to
     `POST /channels/{id}/integrations/kick/connect` with `scopeSetKey: "kick.chat"` (the generic
     connect flow the other tiles already use — no new plumbing).
  2. Chat feed: messages can now arrive with provider `"kick"` (same canonical shape as twitch/youtube)
     — include it wherever the feed tags messages by channel provider (same treatment as the earlier
     YouTube entry below).
- **Why:** slice 3b-2c shipped — Kick send + native replies + moderation + webhook chat read are live
  on the backend; a streamer who connects Kick with the `kick.chat` scopes gets their Kick chat in the
  combined feed and the bot replying/moderating there.
- **Where:** `feature/integrations` (tile renders from the status read model — possibly zero work if
  tiles are data-driven), chat feed provider tagging. No API contract change beyond the extra status row.
- **Done when:** the Kick tile connects end-to-end against a real Kick account and a Kick chat message
  renders in the feed with its provider tag.

### 2026-07-11 — Optional: adopt render-manifest + hub event classes for a lighter dashboard
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** two backend surfaces exist that the client can adopt when convenient (both optional —
  nothing breaks if you don't):
  1. `GET /api/v1/channels/{channelId}/render-manifest` returns access (effective role +
     heldActionKeys) + tier-gated features + integration states + missing-scope gaps in ONE call —
     replaces the current 4-endpoint boot fan-out.
  2. The dashboard hub now supports **push classes**: `JoinChannelClasses(channelId, classes)` with
     classes ⊂ `["chat","activity","liveops","music","moderation"]` subscribes only those pushes for
     that channel (core pushes — stream status, config/permission/reward invalidations, alerts — are
     always on). Plain `JoinChannel` still subscribes everything, so the current client keeps working
     unchanged. For multi-watch chat panes, `JoinChannelClasses(id, ["chat","moderation"])` cuts the
     per-channel push volume substantially.
- **Why:** faster boot (one request), less hub traffic per watched channel.
- **Where:** `core/network` (manifest DTO + endpoint), `core/realtime` (hub method), shell boot +
  multi-watch panes. Manifest is in `server/openapi/v1.json`.
- **Done when:** (whenever adopted) the shell boots off the manifest and chat panes join with class
  sets — both verified live.

### 2026-07-11 — Cross-platform chat: YouTube messages now flow — tag the feed by channel provider
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** the chat feed (and the coming multi-watch UI) should tag each message's SOURCE by the
  channel it arrived on. When a streamer with a connected YouTube account goes live on YouTube, the
  backend now provisions their YouTube presence as its **own channel** (`provider: "youtube"` in
  `GET /api/v1/channels`) and pushes its live chat through the same hub as Twitch —
  `DashboardChatMessageDto` with `channelId` = that YouTube channel. **No contract change**: routing
  and tagging key off `channelId` → the channel's `provider` from the channels list. Notes:
  - YouTube messages carry role flags (`isBroadcaster` = channel owner, `isModerator`,
    `isSubscriber` = channel member) but **no badges, no color, no pronouns/avatar enrichment** —
    render with the defaults; a small platform icon per line (from the channel's provider) is the
    intended source tag.
  - Chat history for the YouTube channel comes from the same `GET .../chat/messages` endpoint under
    that channel id.
  - Sending/replying into YouTube chat is NOT wired yet (slice 3) — hide or disable the composer for
    `provider != "twitch"` channels with a "read-only for now" hint.
- **Why:** combined-chat item 6 (backend `6beaa12b`): streamers see chat from every platform they
  stream on in one place. The multi-watch UI you already have a handoff for is the natural home —
  a YouTube channel is just one more channel in the picker.
- **Where:** `feature/chat/` (+ the multi-watch surface), channel picker; provider comes from the
  existing `ChannelDto.provider`. No `v1.json` change.
- **Done when:** with a YouTube-connected account live on YouTube, its messages appear in the
  dashboard feed under the YouTube channel, visually tagged as YouTube, and the composer is
  read-only for that channel.

### 2026-07-10 — Multi-channel chat watch: let a mod monitor several channels at once
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** build the **multi-watch** chat surface — the operator picks several channels and watches all
  their chats at once (side-by-side panes, or one merged feed), so a moderator monitors multiple channels in
  one session. Owner requirement (2026-07-10): "a viewer+ should be able to view multiple chats at once if
  they please so mods can monitor multiple channels at the same time." This is the **cross-channel** half of
  combined chat; the streamer **cross-platform** half (all platforms merged) is a later backend slice (item 6)
  and will reuse the same UI.
- **Why the backend is ready (no contract change):**
  - **Watchable-channel list:** `GET /api/v1/channels` already returns the channels the caller owns **and
    moderates** (`ChannelSummaryDto`, incl. `role`); `GET /api/v1/channels/moderated` lists Twitch-moderated
    channels specifically. Use these to populate the channel picker.
  - **Live feed, many channels at once:** `DashboardHub` now supports a **single connection watching many
    channels concurrently** — call `JoinChannel(channelId)` once per channel to add it, `LeaveChannel(channelId)`
    to drop just that one; disconnect cleans up all. (Previously the hub tracked only the last-joined channel.)
    Every `ChatMessage` hub push already carries **`channelId`** on `DashboardChatMessageDto`, so you can route
    each message to its pane / tag it in a merged feed.
  - **Scrollback per channel:** `GET /api/v1/channels/{channelId}/chat/messages` (same `DashboardChatMessageDto`
    shape) for each watched channel's history.
- **Where:** `feature/chat/` (new multi-pane / merged mode + channel picker); `core/realtime` hub client
  (`JoinChannel`/`LeaveChannel` per selected channel; route by `channelId`). No `v1.json` change — contract is
  unchanged; nothing to re-sync.
- **Note (backend follow-up, not blocking you):** the hub's `JoinChannel` currently gates on Gate-1 entry
  (`CanResolveTenantAsync`) only, while the REST chat-history path also requires Gate-2 `chat:read`. That
  consistency + the exact read floor for multi-watch ("viewer+" vs the current `chat:read` Mod-default) is an
  open backend decision; build the picker from the channels the list endpoints return (already access-scoped)
  and it'll be correct regardless.
- **Done when:** an operator can select 2+ channels they own/moderate and see all their live chats at once
  (panes or merged, each line clearly tagged with its channel), add/remove a channel without dropping the
  others, and scrollback loads per channel.

### 2026-07-04 — Send channel context on user lookups; use analytics endpoints for participant stats
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** two client changes in the KMP network layer. (1) When the dashboard is operating on a
  channel, send that channel's id with user-lookup calls (`X-Channel-Id` header or `?channelId=`) —
  affects `GET /api/v1/users` (search) and `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` / `{id}/profile`. (2) In
  `ParticipantApi`, stop calling `GET /api/v1/users/{id}/stats` for *other* users — that endpoint is
  self-only and returns 403 for foreign ids (always has). Use the per-viewer analytics endpoints
  instead: `GET /api/v1/analytics/viewers/{viewerUserId}` (+ `/engagement`, `/streak`), which allow
  the viewer themself **or** channel managers.
- **Why:** a security pass locked every endpoint to an explicit permission. User search and foreign-
  profile reads are now authorized against the *channel you manage* — without the channel id the
  backend assumes your own channel, so a moderator browsing someone else's dashboard would get 403s.
  The stats swap fixes the participant panel showing errors for every viewer except yourself.
- **Where:** `core/network` (client + DTOs unchanged — no contract change, only which endpoint is
  called and the channel-context header/query); permission floors in `docs/bot-capabilities.md` §1.
- **Done when:** user search + participant profile/stats panels work when signed in as a moderator
  managing another user's channel (not just as the broadcaster), and the participant panel shows
  stats for any viewer via the analytics endpoints.

### 2026-07-04 — New SignalR hub events to consume (live-update surfaces)
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** the backend now pushes events that previously never reached clients. Two dedicated hub
  methods: `StreamInfoChanged { broadcasterId, broadcasterDisplayName, title, gameName }` (title/
  category edits) and `RewardChanged { broadcasterId, action: created|updated|removed, rewardId,
  title, cost?, isEnabled?, timestamp }`. Plus new `ChannelEvent` types: `poll_begin/progress/end`,
  `prediction_begin/progress/lock/end`, `hype_train_begin/progress/end`, `shoutout_sent`,
  `shoutout_received`, `ad_break_begin`, `shield_mode_begin/end`, `moderator_added/removed`,
  `vip_added/removed` (payload DTOs in `server/src/NomNomzBot.Api/Hubs/Dtos/AlertDtos.cs`).
- **Why:** pages currently go stale — stream-info panel, rewards page, live-ops poll/prediction
  panels, mod roster, and the activity feed can now update live instead of on refetch.
- **Where:** consume via the existing SignalR client (`HubEvent.kt`); unknown events are currently
  ignored so nothing breaks until you wire each one.
- **Done when:** each listed event updates its owning page/panel live (stream info, rewards queue/
  list, polls, predictions, hype train, moderation roster, activity feed + ad-break countdown).
- **Update (same day) — `ConfigChanged` hub event:** every config CRUD now broadcasts
  `ConfigChanged { broadcasterId, domain, entityId?, action: created|updated|deleted|toggled }` to the
  channel group. Wire the SignalR client to **invalidate/refetch that domain's query** so a second
  open dashboard never goes stale. Domain strings (closed set): `commands`, `timers`, `pipelines`,
  `event-responses`, `rewards`, `economy-config`, `earning-rules`, `catalog`, `moderation-rules`,
  `blocked-terms`, `automod`, `tts-config`, `music-config`, `sr-config`, `webhooks`, `widgets`,
  `features`, `quotes`, `builtins`, `channel-settings`, `roles-permits`. Also: `MusicStateChanged`
  now actually fires (poller + instant on skip/pause/resume), and now-playing finally reports real
  play/pause + progress.
- **Update (same day):** hub payloads now also carry hydrated user info — additive nullable fields,
  omitted from JSON when null: `avatarUrl`, `pronouns` (display string like `"they/them"`),
  `communityStanding` (`Everyone|Subscriber|Vip|Artist|Moderator`) on `FollowAlertDto`,
  `RewardRedeemedDto`, `RoleChangedAlertDto`, `ShoutoutReceivedAlertDto`, and the chat message DTO
  (`avatarUrl` + `pronouns`); `ModActionDto` gets the same as `targetDisplayName`/`targetAvatarUrl`/
  `targetPronouns`/`targetCommunityStanding` (the moderated viewer). Render avatars + pronoun badges
  wherever these events surface.

### 2026-07-04 — Read the bot capability & permission reference before designing new pages
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** `docs/bot-capabilities.md` is the designer-facing inventory of everything the bot can do —
  every domain, every page/panel implied, built vs specced-only, real-time surfaces, public pages.
  **Section 1 (permission system) is required reading**: read floors hide pages, manage floors disable
  actions with a reason tooltip, Critical capabilities are Broadcaster-locked, and the Twitch-scope
  "action-required" flow needs its own UI states on every feature that can be enabled.
- **Why:** every feature missed is a page or component not designed; the permission model changes the
  states every page needs (read-only vs write vs scope-gated).
- **Where:** `docs/bot-capabilities.md`; deeper detail in `.claude/docs/design/spec/frontend-ia.md`
  and `roles-permissions.md`.
- **Done when:** you've read it and the §14 "specced but not built" table is on your design backlog.

## Done

_(completed entries move here, with their commit hashes)_

### 2026-07-10 — Activity feed: show the actor name on follow/sub/cheer/raid events — DONE (backend, option b)
- Resolved backend-side: `NotifyChannelAsync` was hardcoding the top-level `userId`/`userDisplayName`
  to null; the actor-bearing broadcasters (follow, subscription/resub/gift, cheer, raid, shoutouts,
  moderator/VIP role changes) now pass the actor through, and the Kotlin `HubChannelEvent` already
  parsed those fields — the feed renders names with **zero frontend work**. Anonymous gifts/cheers
  arrive as "Anonymous". No `v1.json` change (hub-only contract).

### 2026-07-10 — i18n string bundle re-fetched ~30× on boot — DONE `b6dbfbb1`
- Done by the backend track directly (owner directed the UI work). `core/i18n/BundleCachingResourceReader.kt`
  caches the `.cvr` bundle once per session behind `LocalAppLocale`; boot now reads the bundle a single time
  instead of per-string. Verified in `:composeApp:jvmTest` (green).

### 2026-07-10 — VIP-lowerable actions + quotes:delete split — DONE (frontend consume + `ba9167a4` `5c56dc05` `8a9e305e`)
- Done by the backend track directly (owner directed the UI work). **Superseded the original framing:** the
  final model is NOT "default floors lowered to VIP". Defaults stay at the Twitch base; the broadcaster
  **lowers via a per-action override** down to a VIP floor for non-harmful actions (`ba9167a4`). The dashboard
  reflects this through the new `ResolvedAccessDto.heldActionKeys` (`8a9e305e`, `GET /roles/effective/me`):
  page visibility = `role clears readFloor` **OR** `readActionKey ∈ heldActionKeys`, so a broadcaster-lowered
  page surfaces to a VIP/Sub without changing the two-plane default. Quote add/edit gate on `quotes:write`,
  delete on `quotes:delete` (`5c56dc05`) via disable-with-reason. `ShellNav`/`ShellAccessController`/
  `QuotesAccess` + tests (`ShellNavTest` 14/0, `QuotesAccessTest` 3/0, `ShellAccessControllerTest` 10/0);
  Kotlin DTO field registered in `ApiContractTest` (1/0). `:composeApp:jvmTest` + `compileKotlinWasmJs` green.

### 2026-07-05 — `ShellNavTest` red after sidebar reorder (18159a7) — DONE (reconciled; jvmTest green 14/0)
- Reconciled as part of the `heldActionKeys` shell work: `ShellNav.pages`, the `NavGroup` order, and
  `ShellNavTest` now agree, and `:composeApp:jvmTest` is green (14/14) — verified locally before push. The
  local-only red is cleared.
