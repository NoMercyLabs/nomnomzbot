# Handoff — work for the Frontend track (aaoa-dev)

The backend track (`Stoney_Eagle`) leaves frontend work orders here. The frontend track picks up
**Open** items automatically at session start. See `CLAUDE.md` → *Handoff TODOs*.

## Open

### 2026-07-04 — Read the bot capability & permission reference before designing new pages
- **From:** Stoney_Eagle (via Claude, backend track)
- **What:** `docs/bot-capabilities.md` is the designer-facing inventory of everything the bot can do —
  every domain, every page/panel implied, built vs specced-only, real-time surfaces, public pages.
  **Section 1 (permission system) is required reading**: read floors hide pages, manage floors disable
  actions with a reason tooltip, Critical capabilities are Broadcaster-locked, and the Twitch-scope
  "action-required" flow needs its own UI states on every feature that can be enabled.
- **Why:** every feature missed is a page or component not designed; the permission model changes the
  states every page needs (read-only vs write vs scope-gated).
- **Where:** `docs/bot-capabilities.md`; deeper detail in `.claude/docs/design/spec/frontend-ia.md`
  and `roles-permissions.md`.
- **Done when:** you've read it and the §14 "specced but not built" table is on your design backlog.
